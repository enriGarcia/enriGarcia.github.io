#### <u>Hessian with Mini-Batches for Electrical Demand Prediction</u>
*The steepest descent method is frequently used for neural network tuning. Mini-batches are commonly used to get better tuning of the steepest descent in the neural network. Nevertheless, steepest descent with mini-batches could be delayed in reaching a minimum. The Hessian could be quicker than the steepest descent in reaching a minimum, and it is easier to achieve this goal by using the Hessian with mini-batches. In this article, the Hessian is combined with mini-batches for neural network tuning. The discussed algorithm is applied for electrical demand prediction.*

#### <u>Novel nonlinear hypothesis for the Delta Parallel Robot modeling</u>
*In previous investigations, the nonlinear hypothesis use the linear bounded maps. Nonlinear hypothesis are described as the combination of the first order terms, and after of the mentioned combination, one bounded map is applied to alter the result. This document proposes two nonlinear hypothesis which use different structures instead of using the linear bounded maps. They are termed as novel nonlinear hypothesis and second order nonlinear hypothesis and their goal is to improve the second order processes modeling. The proposed nonlinear hypothesis are described as the combination of the first order and second order terms. Since the delta parallel robot is a second order process, it is an excellent platform to prove the effectiveness of the two proposed hypothesis.*

#### <u>Trajectory tracking of the robot end effector for the minimally invasive surgeries</u>
*The surgery technology has been highly investigated, with the purpose to reach an efficient way of working in medicine. Consequently, robots with small tools have been incorporated in many kind of surgeries to reach the following improvements: the patient gets a faster recovery, the surgery is not invasive, and the robot can access to the body occult parts. In this article, an adaptive strategy for the trajectory tracking of the robot end effector is addressed; it consists of a proportional derivative technique plus an adaptive compensation. The proportional derivative technique is employed to reach the trajectory tracking. The adaptive compensation is employed to reach approximation of some unknown dynamics. The robot described in this study is employed in minimally invasive surgeries.*

#### <u>Unscented Kalman filter for learning of a solar dryer and a greenhouse</u>
*An unscented Kalman filter can be applied for the experimental learning of the solar dryer for oranges drying and the greenhouse for crop growth to know better the processes and to improve their performances. The contributions of this document are: a) an unscented Kalman filter is designed for the learning of nonlinear functions, b) the unscented Kalman filter is applied for the experimental learning of the two mentioned processes.*

#### <u>Structure Regulator for the Perturbations Attenuation in a Quadrotor</u>
*In this work, we study the structure regulator for the perturbations attenuation which is based on the infinite structure regulator. The structure regulator is able to attenuate the perturbations if the transfer function of the departures and perturbations has a numerical value almost equal to zero, and it does not require the perturbations to attenuate them. We apply the structure regulator and the infinite structure regulator to a quadrotor which maintains the horizontal position with respect to the earth for the step and sine perturbations.*

#### <u>Mínimos Cuadrados Recursivos para un Manipulador que Aprende por Demostración</u>
*En este trabajo, se desarrolla un sistema de control automatizado para permitir que un manipulador aprenda y planifique las trayectorias a partir de las demostraciones dadas por la mano de un usuario. La entrada de datos es adquirida por un sensor, y se aprende su comportamiento a través de un algoritmo de aprendizaje automático basado en los mínimos cuadrados recursivos. Se utiliza un perfil de trayectoria de interpoladores a tramos para evitar el movimiento impulsivo del manipulador. Se realiza el análisis de las cinemáticas directa e inversa para obtener los valores de las variables articulares para el manipulador. Se crea un modelo dinámico usando la formulación de Newton-Euler. Se aplica un control proporcional derivativo al sistema. Los sistemas de monitoreo y control se implementan en una plataforma embebida para fines de prueba.*

#### <u>Learning of operator hand movements via least angle regression to be teached in a manipulator</u>
*In this document, a control system is developed to allow a manipulator to learn and plan references from demonstrations given by an operator hand. Data entry is acquired by a sensor and is learned by the generalized learning model with least angle regression to create a desired reference in three dimensional space. A fifth reference profile is employed to smooth the desired reference. Direct and inverse kinematics are gotten to represent the transformation between the three dimensional space and each of the manipulator links. A dynamic model is gotten using Newton–Euler formulation. An evolving proportional derivative (PD) control is applied to get that the manipulator end effector follows the operator hand movements. The monitoring and control systems are implemented in an embedded platform for testing purposes.*

#### <u>Stabilization of the robotic arms</u>
*The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) a proportional-derivative controller with inverse dead-zone is addressed for the regulation of robotic arms, where the inputs dead-zone is cancelled with the inverse dead-zone, 2) stability of the mentioned technique is assured, and 3) the considered strategy is validated by two examples.*

#### <u>Trajectory planning and collisions detector for robotic arms</u>
*The major contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) the Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi (GJK) algorithm is a collisions detector algorithm, a modified Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi algorithm is presented, the proposed GJK algorithm uses a different distance, (2) some examples of GJK algorithm are presented, in the last example, the GJK distance algorithm is used to detect the collisions of a camera with its environment inside of a warehouse, the camera cannot cross any part of the structure of the warehouse, the camera needs to go around the structure, when the camera touches the structure, the camera goes to the right or to the left, (3) the time used in a cycle of work of the transelevator robotic arm is presented, it can be extended to other kind of robotic arms, (4) some examples of the time used in a cycle of work are presented, in the least example, the algorithm is used to control the time needed for the transelevator to go from one place to other one, (5) this paper presents a new trajectory planning algorithm which divides the trajectory in n periods, when n is equal to 2, the proposed algorithm is the same as other algorithms, but for n higher than 2, the proposed algorithm gives other optional trajectories, so the proposed algorithm lets the designer to take a better trajectory than with the previous algorithms, (6) some examples of the proposed trajectories planning algorithm are presented, in the least example, the proposed trajectory planning algorithm is used to control the movements of a transelevator inside of a warehouse.*

*In this research, it is simulated the computed movements of a transelevator inside of a warehouse in virtual reality. This transelevator can be used to move some load from the floor to the deposit, and from the deposit to the floor, or can be used move the load from one place of the deposit to another one. The virtual reality is simulated using the graphic designer Quest3D. It is presented the simulation of the system*
