#### <u>Structure Regulator for the Perturbations Attenuation in a Quadrotor</u>
*In this work, we study the structure regulator for the perturbations attenuation which is based on the infinite structure regulator. The structure regulator is able to attenuate the perturbations if the transfer function of the departures and perturbations has a numerical value almost equal to zero, and it does not require the perturbations to attenuate them. We apply the structure regulator and the infinite structure regulator to a quadrotor which maintains the horizontal position with respect to the earth for the step and sine perturbations.*

#### <u>Mínimos Cuadrados Recursivos para un Manipulador que Aprende por Demostración</u>
*En este trabajo, se desarrolla un sistema de control automatizado para permitir que un manipulador aprenda y planifique las trayectorias a partir de las demostraciones dadas por la mano de un usuario. La entrada de datos es adquirida por un sensor, y se aprende su comportamiento a través de un algoritmo de aprendizaje automático basado en los mínimos cuadrados recursivos. Se utiliza un perfil de trayectoria de interpoladores a tramos para evitar el movimiento impulsivo del manipulador. Se realiza el análisis de las cinemáticas directa e inversa para obtener los valores de las variables articulares para el manipulador. Se crea un modelo dinámico usando la formulación de Newton-Euler. Se aplica un control proporcional derivativo al sistema. Los sistemas de monitoreo y control se implementan en una plataforma embebida para fines de prueba.*

#### <u>Learning of operator hand movements via least angle regression to be teached in a manipulator</u>
*In this document, a control system is developed to allow a manipulator to learn and plan references from demonstrations given by an operator hand. Data entry is acquired by a sensor and is learned by the generalized learning model with least angle regression to create a desired reference in three dimensional space. A fifth reference profile is employed to smooth the desired reference. Direct and inverse kinematics are gotten to represent the transformation between the three dimensional space and each of the manipulator links. A dynamic model is gotten using Newton–Euler formulation. An evolving proportional derivative (PD) control is applied to get that the manipulator end effector follows the operator hand movements. The monitoring and control systems are implemented in an embedded platform for testing purposes.*

#### <u>Stabilization of the robotic arms</u>
*The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) a proportional-derivative controller with inverse dead-zone is addressed for the regulation of robotic arms, where the inputs dead-zone is cancelled with the inverse dead-zone, 2) stability of the mentioned technique is assured, and 3) the considered strategy is validated by two examples.*

#### <u>Trajectory planning and collisions detector for robotic arms</u>
*The major contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) the Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi (GJK) algorithm is a collisions detector algorithm, a modified Gilbert–Johnson–Keerthi algorithm is presented, the proposed GJK algorithm uses a different distance, (2) some examples of GJK algorithm are presented, in the last example, the GJK distance algorithm is used to detect the collisions of a camera with its environment inside of a warehouse, the camera cannot cross any part of the structure of the warehouse, the camera needs to go around the structure, when the camera touches the structure, the camera goes to the right or to the left, (3) the time used in a cycle of work of the transelevator robotic arm is presented, it can be extended to other kind of robotic arms, (4) some examples of the time used in a cycle of work are presented, in the least example, the algorithm is used to control the time needed for the transelevator to go from one place to other one, (5) this paper presents a new trajectory planning algorithm which divides the trajectory in n periods, when n is equal to 2, the proposed algorithm is the same as other algorithms, but for n higher than 2, the proposed algorithm gives other optional trajectories, so the proposed algorithm lets the designer to take a better trajectory than with the previous algorithms, (6) some examples of the proposed trajectories planning algorithm are presented, in the least example, the proposed trajectory planning algorithm is used to control the movements of a transelevator inside of a warehouse.*

#### <u>A Transelevator Moving Inside of an Automatic Warehouse in Virtual Reality</u>
*In this research, it is simulated the computed movements of a transelevator inside of a warehouse in virtual reality. This transelevator can be used to move some load from the floor to the deposit, and from the deposit to the floor, or can be used move the load from one place of the deposit to another one. The virtual reality is simulated using the graphic designer Quest3D. It is presented the simulation of the system*
